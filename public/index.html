            <h2>If This Sounds Like You, You're Not Alone.</h2>
            <p>Every gym owner we work with came to us feeling one of these things.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pain__grid">
            <div class="pain-card">

                <h3>"I'm doing everything right, but the floor is still half empty at 6 PM."</h3>
                <p>You've tried the Instagram posts. The flyers. The buddy referral discounts. You're putting in 14-hour
                    days and still watching members quietly cancel through an app notification at midnight. It's not your
                    gym — it's that nobody knows it exists yet.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pain-card">
                <div class="pain-card__icon">💸</div>
                <h3>"I spent $3,000 on ads last month and got 2 sign-ups."</h3>
                <p>You hired a marketing agency that promised the world. They used the same cookie-cutter playbook they
                    use for dentists and restaurants. Three months later, you're out thousands of dollars with nothing to
                    show but a prettier Instagram grid and a sick feeling in your stomach.</p>

                <div class="pain-card__icon">😰</div>
                <h3>"I lie awake at 2 AM doing the math on whether I can make rent this month."</h3>
                <p>Your equipment lease is due. Your trainers need to be paid. And that new gym down the street just
                    launched a $9.99/month promo. You didn't get into this to be a spreadsheet warrior — but here you
                    are, running out of runway and running out of ideas.</p>

                <div class="pain-card__icon">😤</div>
                <h3>"Members keep leaving and I don't even know why."</h3>
                <p>You put your soul into programming. You remember their names. You high-five them at the door. Then one
                    day they just stop showing up. No goodbye, no feedback — just a cancellation email. And it stings
                    every single time because this isn't just a business to you. It's personal.</p>

            <h2>Here's the Truth No One Tells You:</h2>
            <p class="bridge__lead">Your gym doesn't have a quality problem. It has a visibility problem.</p>
            <p>The best gym in your city could be yours — with the best coaches, the cleanest facility, the most
                life-changing programs — and it won't matter if the people who need you most don't know you're there.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the mediocre gym two miles away is packed because they have a marketing system that works
                while they sleep.</p>
            <p><strong>That's not fair. But it's fixable.</strong></p>
            <p>We built Gym Grow for one reason: because gym owners like you deserve a marketing partner who actually
                understands what it feels like to pour your heart into something and wonder if anyone notices.</p>

            <p>We don't just run ads. We build the entire system that turns strangers into members who stay for years.

                <h3>Leads That Actually Show Up</h3>
                <p>We run hyper-targeted Facebook & Google ads that don't just get clicks — they get real people in your
                    area who are actively looking for a gym like yours. No tire-kickers. No coupon-chasers. Real humans
                    who are ready to commit.</p>

                <h3>A Website That Works as Hard as You Do</h3>
                <p>Your current site probably looks fine. But looking fine and converting visitors into trial bookings
                    are two completely different things. We build fast, mobile-first pages designed around one job:
                    getting that first visit booked.</p>

                <h3>Members Who Stay (and Bring Friends)</h3>
                <p>Most gyms lose members silently. We build automated email and SMS sequences that check in on
                    at-risk members before they ghost, celebrate their milestones, and make them feel like they belong to
                    something bigger than a gym — a community they can't imagine leaving.</p>

                <h3>Organic Growth That Compounds</h3>
                <p>SEO, content marketing, and social media strategy that doesn't just look good — it puts your gym at
                    the top of Google when someone searches "best gym near me." Month after month, the leads get cheaper
                    and the momentum builds.</p>
